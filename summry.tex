mutable = mutable means the value can be changed
immutable = immutable means the value cannot be changed

mutable data types = object and array
immutable data types = number, string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, bigint, function

Primitive data types = number, string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, bigint
